# TemplesDAO
We aim to preserve Buddhist arts and assets throughout Japan. The main benefactor is Suiundoh, Inc., whose main business is restoring temples, national treasures and Buddha statues. Suiundohâ€™s plan is to collect sustainable financial support by staking, and providing supporters with Perks at the same time in an effort to fulfill gaps from other philanthropic aid.
